# Caesar Cipher Encryption

Caesar Cipher with Tkinter (Python)
The Caesar Cipher is an early encryption method used by the Emperor Julius Caesar. The action of a Caesar cipher is to replace each letter with a different one a fixed number (shift) of places down the alphabet.

```
Shift Key: 23
Plaintext:  THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG
Ciphertext: QEB NRFZH YOLTK CLU GRJMP LSBO QEB IXWV ALD
```

The code uses the Python Tkinter library, which is very popular for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
